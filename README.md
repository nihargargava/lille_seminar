This is a presentation I gave at [CAP 2022](https://www-lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~duchamp/Conferences/CAP9_2022.html).

[reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) was used to make these slides. The visualizations were made using [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) and were integrated inside using the plugin [reveald3](https://github.com/gcalmettes/reveal.js-d3). See `index.html` for the code of the slides and the folder `LatticeAnimation/` for the `d3.js` scripts of all the visualizations. 


 You can can run these slides from the link below. The final result contains lots of visualizations and a live numerical simulation to explain the Siegel mean value theorem!
